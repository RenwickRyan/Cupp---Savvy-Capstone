Revised - Intro 9.21.20

Hi, I’m Ryan. It’s nice to meet you. 

I am currently managing a café called The Mud House, down on Cherokee St.

I am making my transition to tech by attending the Savvy Coders - full stack program. For my capstone project at Savvy, I am working on a platform for building a community centered around coffee cupping. Cupping is fun way to take a comparative look at the various characteristics of coffee; such as flavor, aroma & texture.

This SPA will allow folks to engage with one another and provide tools to organize and implement cuppings at home, stores and virtually.
